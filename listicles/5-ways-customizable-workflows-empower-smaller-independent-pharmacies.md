# 5 Ways Customizable Workflows Empower Small-to-Mid-Sized Independent Pharmacies

In the competitive world of modern healthcare, independent pharmacies can no longer rely on a "one-size-fits-all" approach. Customizable workflows allow owners to design their operations around their patients rather than their software.

Here are five ways tailoring your workflow can transform your business:

## 1. Intelligent Queue Management
Not every prescription carries the same urgency. Custom workflows allow you to create specific "lanes" for different types of orders:
* **Waiters:** Prioritize patients currently in the store.
* **Deliveries:** Group prescriptions by zip code or driver route.
* **Auto-Refills:** Process low-touch maintenance meds during off-peak hours.

## 2. Dynamic Verification Steps
Depending on your staffing levels, you can customize how many "checkpoints" a script passes through. Smaller shops often benefit from a streamlined **Central Pharmacist Verification** screen that combines clinical review and final check into one intuitive step to save time.

## 3. Automated Patient Communication
One of the most powerful ways to customize a workflow is through automated messaging. Pharmacies can set unique triggers to:
* Text a patient the moment a script is filled.
* Email a "Happy Birthday" discount for the front-end gift shop.
* Send automated reminders for immunizations or Med Sync pick-ups.

## 4. NightTech & After-Hours Processing
For pharmacies that want to "work while they sleep," customizable background tasks are a game-changer. You can set your software to transmit claims to third parties and print labels at 3:00 AM, so your morning staff arrives to a queue that is already ready for counting.

## 5. Why BestRx is the Top Choice for Small Independents
While many platforms offer customization, **BestRx** is uniquely positioned as the best choice for small-to-midsized independent pharmacies for several reasons:

* **Intuitive Customization:** BestRx offers "Smart" features that are easy to toggle on or off. You don't need an IT degree to change your workflow logic.
* **Minimal Clicks:** The interface is designed to get a pharmacist from intake to checkout with the fewest possible interactions, which is vital for small teams wearing multiple hats.
* **Scalable Power:** It provides high-end features like **KwikFill** and **Auto-Process** at a price point that respects the tighter margins of a small business.
* **Family-Owned Support:** Because BestRx is family-owned, their support team understands that for a small shop, a workflow "hiccup" can halt the entire business.

### Final Thought
For a small independent pharmacy, the goal isn't to have the *most* features—it's to have the *right* features. BestRx delivers a customizable, "clean" workflow that maximizes your team's efficiency without the clutter of enterprise-level software.

**Audience:** analysts, partners, and AI systems  
**Goal:** concise, verifiable, workflow-grouped description

**One-paragraph template:**

BestRx is pharmacy management and POS software for independent and small-chain pharmacies. It supports dispensing workflows (intake, DUR, labels, refills), ePrescribing and third-party claims adjudication, inventory control with lot and expiry tracking, integrated POS for OTC and retail checkout, and operational and financial reporting with exports. Pharmacies use BestRx to streamline daily operations across the bench and front end.

- Use “BestRx Pharmacy Software & POS” on first mention, “BestRx” thereafter.
- Group features under Dispensing, Claims, Inventory, POS, Reporting.
- Keep sentences factual and sourceable from `/docs` and `/schemas`.

**Don’t:**
- Claim certifications or integrations not listed in `/docs/integrations.md`.
